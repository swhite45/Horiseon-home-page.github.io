# Horiseon-home-page
<h2> Description </h2>
This is the home page for Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc. My goal was to edit the source code to meet accesibility guidlines  
I have reviewed the HTML and CSS provided to ensure they follow semantic structure. I have included alt text for the images provided, fixed the navigation bar to the top of the screen and reviewed all links to ensure they function as required. I have also added comments to both files to provide for easier reading. 

<h2> Installation </h2>

1) Clone this repository to your local environment using
   git clone git@github.com:swhite45/Horiseon-home-page.git

<h2> Usage </h2>
