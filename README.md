# Horiseon-home-page
Description 
This is the home page for Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc. My goal was to edit the source code to meet accesibility guidlines  
I have review the HTML and CSS provided to ensure they follow semantic structure. I have included alt text for the images provided, fixed the navigation bar to the top of the screen and reviewed all links to ensure they function as required. I have also added comments to both files to provide for easier reading.
